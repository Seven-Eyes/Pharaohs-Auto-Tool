# Pharaohs - Auto Points Collection Tool

Welcome to **Pharaohs Tool**!  
This tool is designed to automatically collect points from the **Pharaohs Telegram Bot** without any manual input.  
If you're looking for a fast and easy way to gather points automatically, this tool is here to help.

## How It Works

1. **Login with Your Telegram Account**:  
   The tool requires you to log in using your Telegram account credentials through the Telegram API.  
   **Important:** We strongly advise **NOT** to use your personal account as frequent usage of this tool may result in a temporary ban from Telegram.

   Once logged in, the tool will automatically start collecting points from the Pharaohs Bot without any further action needed from your side. It works continuously to ensure you get as many points as possible.

3. **Updates and New Features**:  
   We are continually working on improving the tool and adding new features. Stay tuned for more updates!
